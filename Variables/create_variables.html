     <!-- There are three ways to create variables.
     1. var (value can be change from anywhere)
     2. let (value can be changed but only in the block it is created)
     3. const (once value is decided it cannot be changed) -->


     <script>
      var pizza = 2;
      const pi = 3.14;
      let a = 5;
     </script>
